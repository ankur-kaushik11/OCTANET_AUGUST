                Hello, everyone! Allow me to introduce myself. I am Ankur Kaushik, currently pursuing my education at
                JECRC University. I am an ardent lover of all things tech-related, especially programming and coding.
                With a deep passion for the field, I have acquired knowledge and expertise in several programming
                languages, including C++, C, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.Aside from coding, I have a
                deep-rooted hobby in photography, capturing moments that tell stories through my lens. <br><br><br>

                I possess a strong command over multiple programming languages. I am proficient in C++, C, Java, Python,
                and
                web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These languages have provided me with a
                solid foundation in software development and problem-solving techniques. I enjoy exploring the
                intricacies
                of each language and using them to create innovative solutions.
                <br><br><br>
                In my journey as a programmer, I am fortunate to be a part of a talented and like-minded group called
                B-Coders. Our group consists of passionate individuals who share a common interest in programming and
                coding. Together, we collaborate on various projects, exchange knowledge, and engage in discussions to
                enhance our programming skills.
                <br> <br><br>
                B-Coders serves as an excellent platform for us to learn from each other, share coding challenges, and
                explore new concepts in the world of technology. Through this collective effort, we strive to improve
                our
                problem-solving abilities and stay updated with the latest trends in programming.

                    In my journey as a programmer, I am fortunate to be a part of a talented and like-minded group called
                    B-Coders. Our group consists of passionate individuals who share a common interest in programming and
                    coding. Together, we collaborate on various projects, exchange knowledge, and engage in discussions to
                    enhance our programming skills.
                    <br> <br><br>
                    B-Coders serves as an excellent platform for us to learn from each other, share coding challenges, and
                    explore new concepts in the world of technology. Through this collective effort, we strive to improve
                    our
                    problem-solving abilities and stay updated with the latest trends in programming.
